# PCF Pipelines - Tile Installs

This repository contains additional tasks that _extend_ the Pivotal supported [PCF Pipelines](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/pcf-pipelines) to support installing various tiles from scratch on a new foundation. The goal of this is to provide repeatability and auditability via tile configuration in version control and execution via Concourse.
